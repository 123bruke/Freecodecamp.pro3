This project implements a book recommendation system using the ........ free code camp projects
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and cosine similarity.

## Features
- Collaborative filtering
- Sparse matrix optimization
- Real-world dataset (Book-Crossings)
- Clean modular architecture

##  How It Works
1. Filters inactive users and rarely rated books
2. Builds a user–book rating matrix
3. Applies KNN with cosine similarity
4. Recommends similar books based on user behavior

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy
